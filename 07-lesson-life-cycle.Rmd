# The lesson life-cycle

## Scope of this chapter

This chapter focuses on lessons that are being developed
with the intention of becoming officially supported
Carpentries lessons within an existing Lesson Program.
Lessons being developed for unofficial community use
may go through some or all of the stages discussed here,
at the discretion of the lesson's authors. Materials
intended to become part of a **new** Lesson Program
must meet additional requirements as described in
the [Lesson Programs][lesson-programs] section of
The Carpentries Handbook.

## Overview and definitions

Before being adopted as an official Carpentries lesson,
new lessons go through a series of stages designed to
ensure they are sufficiently documented to be teachable
by instructors outside of the initial author group.

In brief: the **pre-alpha** and **alpha** stages focus on
developing the lesson content, while the **beta** stage
focuses on documenting the lesson, so that it can be
taught by anyone with the appropriate subject knowledge.

```{r release-timeline, fig.cap="Four stages of lesson release timeline. Pre-alpha stage includes approval of lesson proposal, review of lesson by Editor, and teaching for the first time. Alpha stage inclues incorporating feedback, announcement to the community, community review, and beta release. Beta stage includes other people start contributing and lesson polishing (Bug BBQ). After official release, lesson advances to stable stage.", echo=FALSE}
include_svg("figures/release_timeline.svg")
```

Lessons start in the **pre-alpha** stage - this stage
encompasses everything from the initial lesson idea
through the first time the lesson is taught. This
first draft is usually written by an individual
or a small group of people. From this first draft, the
original authors organize an **alpha pilot** workshop at
their home organisation, and collect and incorporate
feedback from learners and co-instructors. They go
through this iterative process a few times to bring the
lesson to where it is ready to be taught by other
members of The Carpentries community.

When it is ready for broader teaching and contributions,
the lesson is published for
the first time on Zenodo and is now in the **beta**
stage. The Carpentries staff will assist the lesson
authors in organising **beta pilots**.
**Beta pilots**
should be hosted at a different organisation, and
ideally in a different country than the alpha pilots.
There are generally two or three beta pilots over a
period of six months.

After beta pilots, the lesson authors and Maintainers
incorporate feedback and produce a polished version of
the lesson. It is now mature enough and
documented enough so that anyone interested can teach it. The lesson is published on [Zenodo][zenodo] and listed on the
Lessons page for the appropriate
Lesson Program. It is added to The Carpentries
[workshop request form][wkshp-request], and becomes an officially
supported lesson. The lesson is now considered **stable** and will remain in this stage for as long
as it has active support from its Maintainer team.

If you require access to cloud compute resources to provide
environments for instructors and/or learners to use in pilot workshops,
for example if the lesson content involves specialised compute infrastructure
or a very large data set,
The Carpentries may be able to provide some support.
Contact team@carpentries.org to discuss the options in such cases.

Lessons with grant support may be eligible for
support from The Carpentries staff in some or all of
these stages. If you are pursuing grant funding for
lesson development, please get in touch with us at
team@carpentries.org to discuss opportunities for staff
support.

## Where to start

Before you start developing a new lesson, check
to see if there are already people working on creating
a lesson for this topic.
The [Carpentries Incubator][incubator] is where our community
develops new curricula together.
New lessons are suggested for development and added to the Incubator via the [Proposals][proposals] repository,
so this is the best place to discuss lesson ideas and find collaborators.
You can check existing [issues][issues] on that repository
or start a new issue if you don't see any discussions
on your lesson topic. The [issue template][issue-template] has
a short set of questions for you to answer. Your answers
to these questions will help us to determine an
appropriate next step for your lesson materials or
idea. It's a good idea to also post to our
[discussion forum][discuss] and general [Slack channel][slack] to point interested people to your
Incubator issue.

Once you've submitted an issue to The Incubator,
you will be directed towards one of the following
tracks:

1. the Official Track
1. the Community Track
1. the Carpentries Lab Track


![Flowchart of three lesson development tracks. All lessons start with opening issue in carpentries-incubator repository.](figures/lesson-development-tracks.png)

### Official Track

If The Carpentries have committed to develop a lesson
on this topic (usually through grant funding), our
Curriculum Team will work closely with you from
pre-alpha through stable release, providing support on
each step of the process. Your lesson will be
developed in one of the official Lesson Program GitHub
organisations and released as an official lesson.

### Community Track

If The Carpentries has not committed to develop a
lesson on this topic, but the lesson is potentially of
general interest to our community, the lesson authors
will complete the development process independently.
You will develop
your lesson in the Carpentries Incubator and it will be
made available through the [Community Developed Lessons page](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/).
If the lesson attracts a strong community
of contributors, it will be considered for adoption
as an official Carpentries lesson.

### Carpentries Lab Track

This track is available for lessons on the Community
Track that do not attract a strong contributor
community. Lesson authors will be able to submit their
materials for peer-review. After the peer-review
process, the lessons will be hosted in The Carpentries
Lab and will be officially endorsed by The Carpentries
as high-quality resources.

## Early development (pre-alpha through alpha)

We will create a repository for you in the appropriate
GitHub organization, using The Carpentries
[lesson template][lesson-template]. You will use the
guidelines in the first five chapters of this handbook
to develop your content. The Curriculum Team will
be available to answer questions about the template
and provide pedagogical guidance. For lessons on the
Official Track, authors will meet regularly with
a member of the Curriculum Team to work through the
lesson drafting process.

Lessons on the Community Track will be developed in the Carpentries Incubator.
[This Appendix](the-carpentries-incubator.html) aims to provide
information and further guidance for Incubator lesson developers.

## Field testing: alpha stage

Once your lesson is ready to be taught for the first
time, it will enter the **alpha stage**. Field-testing a
lesson is a good opportunity to receive and incorporate
feedback from learners, instructors, and workshop
helpers who can compare their expectations to
reality. The initial feedback gathered during these first
workshops is really important.

During alpha pilot workshops, instructors and helpers should take detailed notes, including:

- amount of time used to teach each section
- amount of time used for each exercise
- technical issues that arose during installation
- bugs or parts of the lesson code that didn't work as expected
- incorrect or missing exercise solutions
- questions learners asked (and their answers)
- parts of the lesson that were confusing for learners

These notes can be collected in an Etherpad, Google Doc, or other collaborative document that is shared
with co-instructors and workshop helpers. This document should not be shared with workshop learners,
as it would add significantly to their cognitive load.

After the workshop, instructors should share the notes document with the lesson authors - who
will convert the notes into individual issues in the lesson repo. For two-day workshops, lesson authors should expect
to spend at least four hours to create follow-up issues, and at least
eight hours to putting in PRs to fix these issues. For two pilot workshops, this translates
to ~24 hours of work, which can be distributed among the lesson authors.

After incorporating workshop feedback, the lesson is
now ready to be published. For lessons on the Official
Track, our Curriculum Team will create a publication
record on [Zenodo][zenodo]. Lesson authors on the Community or CarpentriesLab tracks
may also choose to publish their lesson on Zenodo. At this stage, the lesson is in **beta**.

## Polishing: beta stage

Now that the lesson has been published, it is ready
for teaching by instructors outside of the original
authorship team, and for contributions from the broader
Carpentries community. For lessons on the Official Track,
Carpentries staff will assist lesson authors in recruiting instructors
to teach beta pilots. Authors for non-Official Track lessons
can recruit beta pilot hosts and instructors through our
[discussion list][discuss], [Slack organization][slack],
on Twitter, and through domain-specific mailing lists
or other community groups they are part of.
For more information about the role played by
and qualifications needed to be a beta pilot instructors, see
our chapter on [community development roles][community-roles].

The **beta stage** lasts approximately 6 months. During this time, members of
The Carpentries community can teach it and contribute to the content of the lesson.
The main goal of this phase of the lesson development is to develop the documentation
needed to ensure that people who have not contributed to the initial development
efforts of the lesson have enough information to teach it effectively.

Beta pilot instructors and helpers should take notes similar
to those described above for alpha pilots, but should (hopefully!)
notice fewer bugs and other issues. As with alpha pilots,
beta pilot instructors will provide the lesson authors with
the notes they've collected during the workshop and the authors
will convert those notes to issues and PRs to resolve concerns
raised during the workshop. Maintainers and other community members
will be involved with this clean-up phase as well.

After this polishing process, and a final check by a member of the
Curriculum Team, your lesson will be published again on Zenodo,
this time in its **stable state**. Official Track lessons will be added to
the appropriate Lesson Program lessons page (e.g. [Data Carpentry's lessons page][dc-lessons])
and to our [workshop request form][wkshp-request]. Anyone may now request a centrally-organized
Carpentries workshop using this curriculum.

For lessons on the CarpentriesLab track, authors will submit their stable stage lessons for review.
The CarpentriesLab Editor will select 2-3 reviewers within The Carpentries community with teaching experience and/o
r appropriate domain expertise, who will provide an open and friendly review of the lesson.
After incorporating feedback and comments from the reviewers, your lesson will be badged
"Reviewed by the Carpentries Community" and will be listed on our websites as such. During this process,
you will have the possibility to include a short paper describing your
lesson in the GitHub repository and have your lesson considered for publication in
[JOSE](http://jose.theoj.org/), the Journal of Open Science Education.
**This review process is in development and we are not yet accepting submissions. Please watch for
announcements as we roll out this program.**

## The stable lesson: Maintenance and lesson releases

Congratulations! Your lesson has now been published and is being actively taught by the community.
That means you're done, right? Not exactly. In order to ensure that your wonderful lesson materials
continue to be relevant and useful, you'll need to build and train a team of lesson Maintainers, who
are responsible for day-to-day upkeep and periodic publication of the lesson.

In a [previous chapter](community-development-roles#lesson-maintainers), we discussed the process for recruiting and training Maintainers. Here, we
will focus on the responsibilities of Maintainers, their day-to-day workflow, and their involvement
in the lesson release process.

As your lesson is taught, workshop instructors and helpers will post issues and pull requests to
the lesson's GitHub repository. These will range from typo corrections, to installation problems,
to recommendations for changing the libraries or function calls demonstrated in the lesson, and will
therefore require different levels of consideration and technical expertise to implement. A typo
correction will probably be taken care of independently by a single Maintainer,
while a proposal to change
the plotting system used in the lesson from matplotlib to seaborn will require significant
discussion. Each lesson Maintainer team will develop their own strategies for managing their work,
but we recommend the following as a starting point.

- Maintainers for a lesson should set a regular meeting to discuss any unresolved issues that have arisen and to decide on the division of responsibilities until
their next meeting.
- One Maintainer commits to monitor the repo daily and respond to new issues and PRs to acknowledge them,
thank the contributor, and apply appropriate [issue tags][issue-tags].
- Once a week, one Maintainer looks at the list of active issues and PRs and assigns each to one team member, based on the time commitment and availability discussed at that month's meeting.
- Individual team members work on resolving issues and PRs, as assigned, asking
their co-Maintainers for review when needed.

**The Maintainer community is working on developing a set of guidelines and template
language for responding to common situations. These guidelines will be added
to this section when they become available.**

The above description focuses on Maintainers' ongoing duties. Maintainers are
also involved with lesson releases, which take place roughly every six months.
Information about lesson releases will be added to a future version of this
handbook.
