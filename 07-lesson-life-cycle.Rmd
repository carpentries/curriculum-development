# The lesson life-cycle

* Definitions of alpha, beta, 1.0
  - Alpha: The stage that it is in the first time it is taught. (in house)
  - Beta: The stage that it is in after the pilots and clean-up. (wider community)
  - pre-release: The stage that it is in after initial publication. (anyone)
  - stable:
* Announcements 
  - letting the community know that the lesson is being prepared for release and what that means
  - Advertising for Bug BBQ
* Bug BBQ
  - How to organize for, how to schedule
  - Communications (when and how to announce)
  - Prep (communicating with maintainers about the process)
  - Facilitating communications during the actual event (real time communications, issue assignments, avoiding duplication of work)
  - Clean-up (maintainers, staff, authors)
    + Lesson release checklist
* Pre-Release Release
* How to communicate about a release
* How to do the release in Zenodo
* Move on website to different category

## Overview of the process

In general, when creating a lesson for The Carpentries, an individual or a small group of people start developing a lesson. From there, they teach it, use the feedback from the learners and from their experience teaching the lesson to improve it. They may go through this iterative process a few times. After that, people not involved in initial development efforts may start contributing to the lesson, and yet others may start teaching it. After a few monthsAt this stage, the lesson is mature enough and documented enough so that anyone interested can teach it.

If you have an idea for a lesson you think would be appropriate for The Carpentries, but you haven't started working on it, the first step is to submit a short proposal that outlines:

- intended audience
- duration in length
- tools used
- learning objectives
- some ideas for datasets to use
- why do you think it would be a good fit for The Carpentries
- the list of people involved in developing the initial version of the lesson

If your proposal is accepted, we will give you write access to the GitHub CarpentriesLab organization to create a repository where you can develop your lesson. Your lesson will be tagged as "pre-alpha". When developing the lesson, you will follow the guidelines that specify a Carpentries lesson.

As you progress, and start planning teaching it for the first time, you will contact one of The Carpentries editors, who will review your lesson and ensure that it is ready to be taught, and may provide some general feedback on the content and structure of the lesson.

When the lesson gets taught for the first time, it will enter the "Alpha" stage. During this period, you will incorporate feedback from the learners at the workshop you're teaching at, and The Carpentries Community Manager will make an announcement that a new "Alpha" lesson is available to contribute on and can be taught. After possibly a few iteration of teaching/integrating feedback, you will let the Carpentries Editors know that your lesson is ready to be officially reviewed. The Editors will select 2-3 people within our community with teaching experience and/or domain expertise, and will provide an open, friendly review of your lesson. After incorporating feedback and comments from the reviewers, your lesson will be "stamped" Carpentries-reviewed and will be listed on our websites as such. During this process, you will have the possibility to include a short paper describing your lesson in the GitHub repository and have your lesson considered for publication in JOSE. Once your lesson has gone through the peer-review process and has been approved by the editor, we will create an official Zenodo release for it, and the lesson will enter the "Beta" stage.

The "Beta" stage lasts 6 months. During this time, we let members of our community teach it and contribute to the content of the lesson. Around the 4th month in this stage, you will organize a "Lesson Polishing" event (aka Bug BBQ). The main goal of this phase of the lesson development is to develop the documentation needed to ensure that people who have not contributed to the initial development efforts of the lesson have enough information to teach it effectively.

After a final check from one of The Carpentries' Editors, we will create a stable release for the lesson that will be listed on our website. Anyone in our community, including our local Carpentries communities, will be able to use the lesson in their workshops or meetups. We will generate new releases every 6 months.
