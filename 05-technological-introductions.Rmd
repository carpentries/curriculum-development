# Technological introductions

Our goal is to make 
developing and contributing to lessons as simple and accessible
as possible. The more people who are able to contribute to a
lesson, the more we can harness community knowledge and 
experience to create materials that are teachable and applicable
in a range of learning contexts. We recognize that technology
can be a major barrier to contribution, and we are currently 
working on a major update to our lesson infrastructure to reduce
this barrier. This chapter reflects our current lesson
infrastructure and describes what lesson authors and other 
contributors need to know to use The Carpentries lesson template. 
In the individual sections below, we have noted whether particular
technological knowledge will remain necessary or be phased out
in upcoming infrastructure updates. 

What knowledge are we assuming lesson authors will have?
What knowledge will this chapter help them gain?

## Lesson hosting and rendering

The Carpentries hosts all of our lessons on [GitHub](https://github.com). We use a 
shared lesson template to provide aesthetic and structural 
consistency across our lessons. Template files for each lesson are 
rendered into a webpage using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - 
a static site generator which is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

You do *not* need to know Ruby or Jekyll to write
or contribute to a Carpentries lesson. However, you will need to 
have these software packages installed on your computer if you
want to preview your lesson materials locally before pushing them
to GitHub.

Information about installing Ruby and Jekyll is available ...

## Using the lesson template

Each lesson is made up of *episodes*, which are focused on a
particular topic and
include time for both teaching and exercises. A lesson repository
(or "repo") includes one file for each episode, 
and a set of helper files that are required to build
the lesson webpage. Most of these helper files are standardized
across all of our lessons and aren't something that lesson
authors or contributors need to interact with. In this section,
we will focus only on the files that you are likely to 
need to create or modify. If you're interested in the details
of how the template is structured, and what each of the files 
does, these details are provided in APPENDIX. We recommend not
spending time learning these details now, as we are in the 
process of greatly simplifying our lesson template. 

### Episode files




### Extras

`reference.md`
:   A reference guide for the lesson.
    The template will automatically generate a summary of the episodes' key points.
    1.  It must use the `reference` layout.
    2.  Its title must be `"Reference"`.
    3.  Its permalink must be `/reference/`.
    4.  It should include a glossary, laid out as a description list.
    5.  It may include other material as appropriate.

`setup.md`
:   Detailed setup instructions for the lesson.
    Note that we usually divide setup instructions by platform,
    e.g.,
    include level-2 headings for Windows, macOS, and Linux
    with instructions for each.
    The [workshop template]({{ site.workshop_repo }})
    links to the setup instructions for core lessons.
    1.  It must use the `page` layout.
    2.  Its title must be `"Setup"`.
    3.  Its permalink must be `/setup/`.
    4.  It should include whatever setup instructions are required.
    
    `_extras/guide.md`
:   The instructors' guide for the lesson.
    This page records tips and warnings from people who have taught the lesson.
    1.  It must use the `page` layout.
    2.  Its title must be `"Instructors' Guide"`.
    3.  Its permalink must be `/guide/`.
    4.  It may include whatever content the author thinks appropriate.

### Lesson Homepage

The lesson homepage provides an overview of the lesson, including
any prequisites, an introduction to the
dataset used, a schedule showing
the episodes and the time alloted for each, and any other
information learners will need for the lesson.

For inspiration to guide you in writing your lesson homepage, 
check out these examples for [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/), [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/).

The lesson homepage is created from the `index.md` file, which is
automatically created when you initialize a lesson repository. You
will need to add the following to this file: 

1. A few paragraphs of explanatory text describing the lesson. 
1. One or more `.prereq` boxes detailing the lesson's prerequisites, giving an overview of the dataset, and/or calling attention to the lesson's Instructor notes.

The schedule will automatically be included in the lesson homepage. 

### Other information 

In addition to populating the lesson content (episodes), 
Instructor's notes, lesson homepage, and other lesson-specific
pages, lesson authors need to make a few changes to the template
files to make sure that the lesson has all of the neccessary 
information. 

1) In the `_config.yml` file, 
* set the `carpentry` variable to the appropriate lesson program,
* set `title` to be the overall title for your lesson,
* set `email` to the correct contact email for your lesson.

`CONTRIBUTING.md`
:   Contribution guidelines.
    The `issues` and `repo` links at the bottom of the file must be changed
    to match the URLs of the lesson:
    look for uses of `FIXME`.

`CITATION`
:   A plain text file explaining how to cite this lesson.

`AUTHORS`
:   A plain text file listing the names of the lesson's authors.

`_extras/about.md`
:   General notes about this lesson.
    This page includes brief descriptions of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry,
    and is a good place to put institutional acknowledgments.

`_extras/discussion.md`
:   General discussion of the lesson contents for learners who wish to know more:
    This page normally includes links to further reading
    and/or brief discussion of more advanced topics.
    1.  It must use the `page` layout.
    2.  Its title must be `"Discussion"`.
    3.  Its permalink must be `/discuss/`.
    4.  It may include whatever content the author thinks appropriate.
