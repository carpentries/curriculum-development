# Deciding what to teach

As discussed in an [earlier chapter](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/conceptual-elements.html#backward-design), the first step in designing a curriculum according to backward design principles is to 
identify the practical skills that you aim to teach. This step is absolutely critical to defining the scope of 
your curriculum and to avoid scope creep, both during initial writing of the lesson materials and later
community-driven development. 

## Target audience

To identify the skills you aim to teach, it is first essential to define your 
target audience, as different audiences will have different needs, as well as different starting skill sets. For
example, Data Carpentry's [Genomics workshop curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) assumes
that learners have some background in the biological sciences and will understand biological terminology and 
abbreviations used in those lessons, but does not assume any prior experience with the tools taught in the lesson,
including The Unix Shell and Amazon Web Services. These assumptions set the stage for lesson development, by 
placing boundaries around what will and won't need to be explained in the lesson.

You probably already have some sense of your target audience. To help refine this sense, ask yourself the 
following questions. Write down your answers and see if you can clearly articulate who is and isn't included
in your audience. Share these thoughts with your colleagues and see if they agree. 

### Audience definition questions
* What is the expected educational level of your audience? - Do you expect most learners to be undergraduate 
students, graduate students, or to have completed graduate school? If you are targeting graduate students, 
do you expect learners to be new graduate students, masters degree holders, or doctoral candidates?

* What type of exposure do your audience members have to the technologies you plan to teach? - Think about the
typical course work that someone in your field has completed when they are at your targeted educational level. 
Have they had classes where they needed to use R, Python, or some other programming language for their homework?
Does your department require any courses on data organization or management? Do students in your field 
ever interact with a remote computing system? Don't worry if the answer to all of these questions is "no", 
most university departments don't build computational training into their undergraduate or graduate programs - 
which is why The Carpentries exists! Talk with others in your field, especially colleagues at different
institutions and in different countries. Having an accurate picture of your target audience's actual exposure 
to these skills will help you plan a realistic curriculum.

[Add some references to papers that conducted data skills training surveys in different domains?]

* What are the pain points they are currently experiencing? - The Carpentries trainings are designed to 
meet learners where they are and help them improve their workflows in a way that is immediately useful for them.
We avoid idealism in favor of realism. Yes, it would be excellent if use of version control was standard 
across the research community, but if the learners at your workshop don't see the immediate benefit of version 
control, they are unlikely to implement it. Talk with students and other new researchers in your field. What are
the computational tasks they spend hours upon hours doing, only to have to redo when they get their reviews 
back from the publisher? What repetitive tasks do they do by hand and find mistakes in weeks or months later? 
People love to share stories like this and you can learn a lot about what others in your field are struggling with
by collecting these stories. These are the skills you should be targeting in your lesson. 

* What types of data does your target audience work with? Is this variable or well-defined? - If you're designing
a domain-specific curriculum, you'll need to consider the range of data types that members of your domain 
community work with. For example, researchers in the social sciences work with a wide range of data types, but
survey data is common in this research community. Data Carpentry elected to develop lessons around closed-ended
survey data, with the hopes of expanding this lesson set to include analysis of free-response text in the future. 
Similarly, a genomics researcher may work with data sets that span multiple species or multiple individuals or 
populations within a species. The Data Carpentry Genomics curriculum development team chose to focus on 
intra-species data sets. Researchers in the field who work with different data types will still be able to 
benefit from the lessons, but choosing a common data type will ensure your lesson is maximally useful for a broad
component of your domain community. It is important to make this decision early on, as trying to include every 
type of data that researchers in your field work with will result in sprawling, ungainly lessons that aren't 
useful for anyone. Choose one thing and do it well!



* Learner profiles
* Determining scope (thinking of where the learners start and where they will end after the workshop)
* Learning pathways (where this lesson fits in and what it leads to)
* How to identify the core competencies you want to teach

As you are planning the design of your lesson material identify:

* Which skills do I use daily in my research workflow?
* Which skills do I use in combination/do I integrate to perform common tasks?
* What are the specificities of the data, datasets, and metadata used in my
  research?
* What are the tools, libraries, packages that are typical of my domain?
* What is the life cycle of my data: How is the data transformed and analyzed
  from acquisition to publication and archival?
  
As an expert in your field, there might be mutliple steps involved in your analysis that you have become so used to, that you might not recognize them as separate steps (expert blind spot, fluid representation). When designing the content of your lesson and curriculum, it is crucial that you identify these intermediate steps that will need to be taught to novices in the field.

It is also however important when building the lesson to organize the content to put useful and applicable examples as early as possible. We have found that in the context of a 2-day workshop, starting with teaching how to generate high-quality plots before teaching about data types leads to more motivated learners than doing the opposite.
