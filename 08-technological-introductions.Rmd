# Technological introductions

Our goal is to make 
developing and contributing to lessons as simple and accessible
as possible. The more people who are able to contribute to a
lesson, the more we can harness community knowledge and 
experience to create materials that are teachable and applicable
in a range of learning contexts. We recognize that technology
can be a major barrier to contribution, and we are currently 
working on a major update to our lesson infrastructure to reduce
this barrier. This chapter reflects our current lesson
infrastructure and describes what lesson authors and other 
contributors need to know to use The Carpentries lesson template. 
In the individual sections below, we have noted whether particular
technological knowledge will remain necessary or be phased out
in upcoming infrastructure updates. 

What knowledge are we assuming lesson authors will have?
What knowledge will this chapter help them gain?

## Lesson hosting and rendering

The Carpentries hosts all of our lessons on [GitHub](https://github.com). We use a 
shared [lesson template](http://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html) to provide aesthetic and structural 
consistency across our lessons. Template files for each lesson are 
rendered into a webpage using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - 
a static site generator which is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

You do *not* need to know Ruby or Jekyll to write
or contribute to a Carpentries lesson. However, you will need to 
have these software packages installed on your computer if you
want to view your lesson materials locally before pushing them
to GitHub.

Information about installing Ruby and Jekyll is available in the APPENDIX. 

## Using the lesson template

Each lesson is made up of *episodes*, which are focused on a
particular topic and
include time for both teaching and exercises. A lesson repository
(or "repo") includes one file for each episode, 
and a set of helper files that are required to build
the lesson webpage. Most of these helper files are standardized
across all of our lessons and aren't something that lesson
authors or contributors need to interact with. In this section,
we will focus only on the files that you are likely to 
interact with. If you're interested in the details
of how the template is structured, and what each of the files 
does, these details are provided in APPENDIX. We recommend not
spending time learning these details now, as we are in the 
process of greatly simplifying our lesson template. 

### Creating your lesson repository

The following sections will guide you through the pieces of 
the lesson template that you will need to modify to create your lesson.
In order to follow along with these examples, you can start by creating your
lesson repository in GitHub. To do this, follow [the setup instructions
on our example lesson][template-setup].

### Lesson homepage

The lesson homepage provides an overview of the lesson, including
any prequisites, an introduction to the
dataset used, a schedule showing
the episodes and the time alloted for each, and any other
information learners will need for the lesson.

For inspiration to guide you in writing your lesson homepage, 
check out these examples for [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/), [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/).

The lesson homepage is built from the `index.md` file, which is
automatically created when you initialize a lesson repository. You
will need to add the following to this file: 

1. A few paragraphs of explanatory text describing the lesson. 
1. One or more `.prereq` boxes detailing the lesson's prerequisites, giving an overview of the dataset, and/or calling attention to the lesson's Instructor notes.

The schedule will automatically be included in the lesson homepage based on information present in the 
episode files. 

### Episode files

The majority of a lessons content is in its episode files. 
Episode files are stored in the `_episodes/` folder within your lesson repo (or in `_episodes_rmd/` for lessons written in R). 
Episode file names must start with a two-digit identifier number (e.g. `01`) followed
by a short descriptive name, separated by a dash (`-`). For example `02-loop.md`, `03-lists.md`. 
The numeric identifier is used to place your episode files in the correct sequence within the lesson. 
Episode files are written in *Markdown* (more on that in a moment) or *RMarkdown*. 

#### Episode headers

When your lesson repository is created, it will start out with one pre-made episode file (`01-introduction.md`).
You can use this file as a template for creating each of your episode files, as it provides an
example of how these files must be structured. The content of this pre-made episode file is shown below:


```
---
title: "Introduction"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "Key question (FIXME)"
objectives:
- "First learning objective. (FIXME)"
keypoints:
- "First key point. Brief Answer to questions. (FIXME)"
---
FIXME

{% include links.md %}
```

The material between the first and second instances of `---` is called the *YAML header*. The information
stored in the YAML header is used by the lesson template to populate important parts of the lesson webpage. 
This section explains each component of the YAML header and what that information is used for. 

For each episode, you will need to create a copy of this file and: 

1. Replace `Introduction` with the episode title (**not** the lesson title) in quotation marks. The episode
title will appear on the episode page and in the schedule that appears on the lesson homepage. 
1. Enter an estimated number of minutes for teaching the episode and an estimated number of minutes for learners to spend completing challenge problems (including class discussion of challenge solutions). These time estimates
will likely be updated by Instructors as they get real-world data on how learners respond to the pacing of
the episodes, but it is useful to have a starting point to benchmark from. The lesson template creates a schedule
from these time estimates and places it on the lesson homepage. 
1. Replace `Key question (FIXME)` with 1-3 motivating questions for the episode, each on a new line and in quotation marks. These motivating questions will appear in the schedule on the lesson homepage. 
1. Replace `First learning objective. (FIXME)` with 3-7 learning objectives for the episode, each on a new line and in quotation marks. For information on writing useful learning objectives, see the [Developing Content](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/developing-content.html) chapter. 
1. Replace `First key point. Brief Answer to questions. (FIXME)` with 3-7 major take-aways from the episode. For
information on how to distill an episode's key points, see the [Developing Content](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/developing-content.html) chapter. Key points for all episodes are shown 
together in the lesson's reference page. 

#### Episode content

After the YAML header, your episode file will contain the content for that episode. This content will likely
include:
*   paragraphs of text
*   lists
*   tables
*   images or figures
*   code chunks
*   special blockquotes, including exercises and solutions (described below)

This content will be written in *Markdown*, a light-weight markup language that makes it possible to create
fancy HTML pages using only a few formating tricks. In this section, we'll cover only the Markdown syntax that
you will need in order to create the content types listed above. You can find more information about Markdown
at https://commonmark.org/help/.

1. Paragraphs of text - To create text paragraphs in Markdown, just type as you normally would! A few neat tricks: 
* surround text with a single pair of stars (`*`) to make text *italic* (`*italic*`)
* use a double pair of stars to make text **bold** (`**bold**`)
* create headers by starting a line of text with two hash signs (`##`)
There are lots of other fancy things you can do, but this should get you started!

1. Lists - To create a numbered list in Markdown, do this:

```
1. A
1. numbered
1. list
```

This will show up like this:
1. A
1. numbered
1. list

Hint: You can use sequential numbers if you want, but it's easier to update the list later if you use only 1s.
Markdown will create the sequence for you. 

To create an un-numbered list in Markdown, do this:

```
* An
* unnumbered
* list
```

This will show up like this:
* An
* unnumbered
* list

1. Tables - To insert a small table into your episode, do this:

```
| Category | Item | 
|--------- | ---- |
| Food     | Sandwich |
| Drink    | Tea | 
| Food     | Apple |
```

This will show up like this:

| Category | Item | 
|--------- | ---- |
| Food     | Sandwich |
| Drink    | Tea | 
| Food     | Apple |


1. Images or figures - Place a copy of the image you would like to display into the `fig` directory. You can
then link to the figure using the syntax:

```
![Figure Description](../fig/figure_file_name.svg)
```

Note about alt text. Question: Is this the "proper" way to insert a figure link? 

1. Code chunks - As discussed in [an earlier chapter](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/developing-content.html), Carpentries workshops are taught using participatory
live coding. Instructors
type the code as they teach it and learners type along with the Instructor. For more information about how
live coding works, and what its advantages and disadvantages are, read that section of our 
[Instructor Training program](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html). The fact 
that Carpentries workshops are taught using live coding means that much of your episode content will be 
*code chunks* - short blocks of code that learners type along with the Instructor and evaluate on their own
machines. Each code chunk should correspond to one interactive session. If learners will be
running the code as two distinct commands, that code should be displayed as two distinct chunks in the episode
file.

You can add a code chunk to your episode using the following syntax: 

```
~~~
pwd
~~~
{: .source}
```

Which will show up like: 

```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pwd
```

Code chunks that learners should type out with the Instructor should use the `{: .source}` tag as shown above.
Chunks that show expected output should use the `{: .output}` tag. Chunks that show an expected error
message should use the `{: .error}` tag.

The generic `{: .source}` tag can be used for all programming languages. To make your code more stylish, 
you can use a language-specific tag (instead of `{: .source}`). This will add things like syntax highlighting
to your code. The language-specific tags available with our lesson template are: 

* `{: .language-bash}`
* `{: .html}`
* `{: .language-make}`
* `{: .language-matlab}`
* `{: .language-python}`
* `{: .language-r}`
* `{: .language-sql}`

You don't need to use these language-specific tags, but they make your lesson a little prettier. 

1. Special blockquotes - Exercises, solutions, helpful tips, and a few other types of special information are
formatted as blockquotes within the episode file. Each blockquote has the same general structure, but ends
with a different tag. The ending tag determines how the blockquote will appear on the lesson webpage. The 
general structure of a blockquote is:

```
> ## Title
>
> text
> text
> text
{: .callout}
```

where the `{: .callout}` tag should be replaced with one of the following as appropriate:

* `{: .callout}` for sharing an aside or comment. Use sparingly.
* `{: .challenge}` for an exercise.
* `{: .discussion}` for a discussion question.
* `{: .solution}` for an exercise solution.

Additional blockquote tags included in our lesson template are described in APPENDIX, however, the four listed
above should cover all normal use cases for a lesson author. 

Exercise solutions are nested within the blockquote for that exercise, as shown below: 

```
> ## Challenge Title
>
> This is the body of the challenge.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > This is the body of the solution.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
```

Code chunks may also be nested within blockquotes as needed. 

### Extras

So far we've covered how to create and format the content of your lesson homepage (in the `index.md` file)
and your lesson episodes (in multiple `.md` files within the `_episodes` directory). This covers most of the
files you will need to work with when you create a new lesson. There are a few remaining files that you will
need to populate in order for your lesson to be fully fleshed out and ready to teach:

1. The Reference page (`reference.md`) - this file will be created automatically and will include a list
of all of the keypoints that you defined in your episode YAML headers. You don't need to do anything to create
this list! However, it's a good idea to add a glossary of terms that are used in your lesson. 

1. The Setup page (`setup.md`) - this file will be created automatically, but needs to be populated with
installation instructions for software learners will need to have before begining the lesson. If learners are
expected to download data prior to the workshop, that data should also be linked and described here. The setup
page may be [quite simple](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/setup.html) or 
[more complex](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html), but should
always include installation information for all three major platforms (Windows, Unix/MacOS, Linux). 

1. The Instructors' Guide (`_extras/guide.md`) - this file should provide additional discussion useful to
instructors,
but not appropriate for inclusion in the main lessons. Remember not to overload on details, and to keep the
information here positive and useful for instructors! This guide should include the following sections:

* Lesson motivation and learning objectives - These concepts should be highlighted in the main lesson material,
but ideas for
explaining these concepts further can be placed here.

* Lesson design - Most lessons contain more material than can be taught in a single workshop.
Describe a general narrative (with time estimates) for teaching either a half day
or full day with this lesson material. You may also choose to include multiple
options for lesson design, or what material can be skipped while teaching.
This section may also include recommendations for how this lesson fits into
the overall workshop.

* Technical tips and tricks - Provide information on setting up your environment for learners to view your
live coding (increasing text size, changing text color, etc), as well as
general recommendations for working with coding tools to best suit the
learning environment.

* Common problems - This can include answers to common learner questions, as well as links to
resources (blog posts, stack overflow answers, etc) that may solve problems that
may occur during a workshop.

### Other information 

In addition to populating the lesson homepage, lesson content (episodes), 
Instructors' guide, and other lesson-specific
pages, lesson authors need to make a few changes to the template
files to make sure that the lesson has all of the neccessary 
information. 

1. In the `_config.yml` file, 
* set the `carpentry` variable to the appropriate lesson program,
* set `title` to be the overall title for your lesson,
* set `email` to the correct contact email for your lesson.

1. In the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, change the `issues` and `repo` links to match the URLs of your lesson.

1. In the `CITATION` file, add information about how to cite your lesson.

1. The `AUTHORS` file should include a list of the lesson's authors. 

### Special notes on RMarkdown

## Working on GitHub

GitHub is a web-based service for hosting code under version control. In addition to being a technical
platform, GitHub is also a social media platform and has its own standards around etiquite and interaction. This
section describes how The Carpentries community tends to interact on GitHub and gives you some tips for 
navigating this new social scene.

All Carpentries lesson materials, whether they are established or in early development, are hosted publically 
on GitHub in one of several *organisations*. The following high-level organisations are managed by The Carpentries:

* [carpentries](https://github.com/carpentries) - hosts The Carpentries website and materials for programs that span individual lesson programs, such as our Instructor Training curriculum and The Carpentries Handbook
* [datacarpentry](https://github.com/datacarpentry) - hosts Data Carpentry specific lesson materials and website
* [librarycarpentry](https://github.com/librarycarpentry) - hosts Library Carpentry specific lesson materials and website
* [swcarpentry](https://github.com/swcarpentry) - hosts Software Carpentry specific lesson materials and website
* [data-lessons](https://github.com/data-lessons) - hosts lessons in development which are targeted to become part of the official Carpentries lesson stack
* [carpentrieslab](http://github.com/carpentrieslab) - community-developed lessons which may or may not become part of the official Carpentries lesson stack

In order to contribute to lesson materials, you will need a GitHub account. 

To manage changes, we follow [GitHub flow][github-flow]. 
Each lesson has two maintainers who review issues and pull requests or encourage others to do so.
The maintainers are community volunteers and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson.
To use the web interface for contributing to a lesson:

1.  Fork the originating repository to your GitHub account.
2.  Within your version of the forked repository, move to the
default branch (e.g. `gh-pages`) and
create a new branch for each significant change being made.
3.  Navigate to the file(s) you wish to change within the new branches and make revisions as required.
4.  Commit all changed files within the appropriate branches.
5.  Create individual pull requests from each of your changed branches
to the `gh-pages` branch within the originating repository.
6.  If you receive feedback, make changes using your issue-specific branches of the forked
repository and the pull requests will update automatically.
7.  Repeat as needed until all feedback has been addressed.

When starting work, please make sure your clone of the originating `gh-pages` branch is up-to-date
before creating your own revision-specific branch(es) from there.
Additionally, please only work from your newly-created branch(es) and *not*
your clone of the originating `gh-pages` branch.
Lastly, published copies of all the lessons are available in the `gh-pages` branch of the originating
repository for reference while revising.
