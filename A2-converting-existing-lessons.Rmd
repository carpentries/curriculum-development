# Adapting Existing Lessons for The Carpentries

A guide for those wishing to adapt existing lesson materials,
written/published in formats other than The Carpentries lesson template,
to conform to the requirements for inclusion in a Carpentries lesson program
or The Carpentries Incubator.

## Lesson Template

Below are some suggested approaches to incorporate previously-written
lesson content into The Carpentries lesson template.
Unfortunately we cannot provide detailed instructions or automated conversion
for content in every format,
but this section includes suggested workflows to adapt content in several
of the most common formats for lessons teaching software and data skills.

## Conversion from Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks in `.ipynb` format can be converted to Markdown via
_File_ -> _Download as_ -> _Markdown (.md)_ in the graphical Notebooks interface
or by using [the `nbconvert` command line tool](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[The `convert_ipynb.py` Python script](utils/convert_ipynb.py),
based on the `convert.py` script written by [Allen Downey](https://www.allendowney.com/wp/) while developing the
[Data Carpentry Astronomy curriculum](https://datacarpentry.github.io/astronomy-python),
processes Jupyter Notebooks such that, afterwards,
the Markdown derived from them
can be more readily incorporated into The Carpentries Lesson Template.
The script makes some assumptions about what your Jupyter notebooks will look like
(e.g. it looks for third-level headings beginning "Exercise" to define exercise blocks),
but it may save you some time if you have a large number of notebooks containing
a lot of code blocks etc.

To be rendered as episodes of a lesson site,
the resulting Markdown generated from the `.ipynb` files processed by `convert_ipynb.py`
will need to have [YAML front matter](#add-yaml-front-matter) added, before being placed in the `_episodes` directory of a lesson repository (see [Markdown](#markdown) below).

## Conversion from RMarkdown

Lesson content written with RMarkdown can be directly included in the lesson template, by adding RMarkdown episodes to the `_episodes_rmd` directory.

[The _Using Rmarkdown_ episode of the Lesson Example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/05-rmarkdown-example/)
provides more details of how to write episodes in RMarkdown.
Briefly, the important points are:

1. You must [add the episode front matter](#add-yaml-front-matter)
   just as you would for standard Markdown.
2. You should commit your RMarkdown files to the `main` branch.
   The lesson build workflows have been configured such that
   any RMarkdown files commited to the `_episodes_rmd` directory
   in the `main` branch of the GitHub lesson repository
   will be converted to standard Markdown and copied to
   the `_episodes` directory of the `gh-pages` branch,
   where the content will be served by GitHub Pages.
3. You should use the `fig.alt` parameter to define the alternative text
   property for any figures/images created by code chunks in your RMarkdown.
4. You will need to write the lesson landing page (`index.md`),
   installation/setup instructions (`setup.md`),
   Instructor Notes (`guide.md`),
   and glossary/reference guide (`reference.md`)
   in standard Markdown.

## Conversion from other formats

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a universal format conversion tool,
which may be able to help when converting other formats
(e.g. ReStructured Text) to Markdown.

## Markdown

Whether you have lesson content already in Markdown (e.g. from GitBook)
or converted to Markdown from a Jupyter Notebook or any other format,
there are some additional steps you will need to take to make this content
compatible with the lesson template:

### Set up a lesson repository

For lessons being submitted to [The Carpentries Incubator](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-lesson-life-cycle.html#where-to-start):
create a new issue to
[the Incubator Proposals repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals)
to request a new lesson repository.
After accepting an invitation, sent by email,
to join the `carpentries-incubator` organisation,
you will receive full administrative access to a new lesson repository
with some brief instructions to help you get started.

For lessons being developed outside The Carpentries Incubator:
follow [the setup instructions in the Lesson Example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html).

**A note about the license and code of conduct**:
[Carpentries lessons use the Creative Commons Attribution version 4.0 (CC-BY) license for lesson material, and the MIT license for any software and example code included in the lesson repository](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.md).
Laws vary from country to country but,
as a general rule,
**changing the license of a project requires explicit agreement**
**from all previous contributors to the repository**.
You should make sure that you have obtained this agreement
before you transfer the material
into the lesson repository (which already includes the license file),
or clearly state that you are re-using material originally created elsewhere
(if the license of the existing material allows this).
Similarly, **we require that all lessons follow [our Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)**,
and you should make sure that you and all of your collaborators have read and
understand this document, and that your existing lesson material complies with
the policies described in it, before you begin working in the new repository.

### Add YAML Front Matter

The Jekyll engine that renders sites on GitHub Pages
identifies Markdown files to build into webpages based on the presence of
[a header section](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/04-formatting/index.html#episode-header),
known as [_front matter_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/),
which is located at the top of the file.
[The _Technological Introductions_ chapter](https://cdh.carpentries.org/technological-introductions.html#episode-files)
details the fields that must be present in this YAML header.
Note: episode files written in RMarkdown must include an additional line,
`source: Rmd`, to be rendered correctly.

If your lesson already includes statements of learning objectives/outcomes,
questions, and/or key points for each section,
this information should be transferred to the YAML header
for the respective episodes.

### Add _alt_ Text to Images

To increase the accessibility of Carpentries lessons,
all images should include a short, descriptive _alternative text_ property.
In Markdown, alternative text (alt text) is added between the `[]` of the
image definition, i.e.

`![Image alt text](path/to/image/file.svg)`

Accessibility consultants Deque provide
[a good overview of the important things to consider when writing alt text](https://www.deque.com/blog/great-alt-text-introduction/),
and a Medium post from [Amy Cesal](https://twitter.com/AmyCesal) gives
[guidance on alt text for data visualisations](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81).


### Add to `_episodes`

To be built by Jekyll and included in the navigation of the resulting lesson site,
Markdown files with front matter should be located in the `_episodes` directory of
your lesson repository.
Other files needed for a lesson, but not located in the `_episodes` directory,
include the lesson landing page (`index.md`),
the installation/setup instructions (`setup.md`),
Instructor Notes as an aid to those teaching the lesson (`guide.md`),
and the glossary/reference guide (`reference.md`).
You can find more complete information about these files, and others included in
the lesson template, in [the _Lesson Organization_ episode of the Lesson Example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/03-organization/index.html#starter-files).

### Organise supporting files

Images used as figures in the lesson should be stored in the `fig` directory,
example code in the `code` directory,
and example data in `data`.
Any other supporting files that do not fit into the previous three categories
can be placed in `files`.
Remember to adjust any internal links in your lesson to match the new locations
of these files.

### Implement formatted blocks

Some of the key visual elements of a Carpentries lesson are the
boxes used for callouts, lesson prerequisites, exercises, solutions, etc.
You should add the appropriate formatting to any relevant parts of your
lesson, so that they render correctly.
Generally speaking, this involves converting these elements to blockquotes
followed by a tag that applies a CSS class to the preceding block.

See [the _Formatting_ episode of the Lesson Example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/04-formatting/index.html#special-blockquotes)
for details and examples.
That page also includes more information about the best way to display
code blocks in the lesson template.

### (Recommended) Centralise Link References

To reduce the effort associated with modifying the target URLs of
links in your lesson if/when they change,
you can collect all these target URLs as Markdown link references,
in the format `[link-ref]: https://carpentries.org`,
in the `_includes/links.md` file of the lesson repository.

You can then refer to these with the syntax `[link text][link-ref]`
after adding `{% include links.md %}` to the very bottom of the page content.

### Complete Lesson Repository Setup

To finish setting up your lesson repository

- fill in any fields marked "FIXME" in the lesson `README.md` and/or `_config.yml`
- list the names of current and past maintainers in the lesson `README.md`
- update the `AUTHORS` and `CITATION` files in the lesson repository
- add the lesson URL and
  [topic tags](https://cdh.carpentries.org/the-carpentries-incubator.html#topic-tags)
  to the _Description_ of your lesson repository on GitHub
