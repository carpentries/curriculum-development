# Community development

## Roles

Our lessons are intended to be teachable by any certified
Carpentries Instructor with the appropriate domain experience
and background knowledge. Lessons should also be appropriate for
learners at different institutions, and not require specialized
local or institutional knowledge. Our lessons attain this 
broad usability by virtue of being the product of many people
at differnt institutions around the world who work together
in different roles to create, test, and iteratively improve and
update lesson materials. 

### Lesson Authors

A lesson may have one or several initial authors. Authors draft
the lesson content, figures, and code and create appropriate challenge problems. Authors should have both appropriate domain
experience - working in the same field as the intended audience for the materials,
and programmatic experience -- regularly using the tools for which they are
developing lessons in their own work. From a technical standpoint, authors
will also need to be familiar with specific technologies that we use for 
developing and hosting The Carpentries lessons - including git, GitHub, Markdown,
RMarkdown, ... But don't panic! If you're not comfortable with any or all of these
tools, we'll walk you through what you need to know to use them [later in this
Handbook][Technological Introductions]. Most importantly, to ensure that lesson materials are consistent with The Carpentries vision and
values, 
lesson authors should be certified Carpentries Instructors or otherwise involved
in The Carpentries community. If a group of authors are writing a lesson
collaboratively, we recommend dividing lessons up by episode, and having only one
author per episode. Clearly defining the learning objectives for each episode
will help avoid overlap and ensure the lesson flows smoothly - but it will
still be important to have regular checkins with all authors. 

### Reviewers

We know no one is perfect! Lesson materials should be read and tested by at least
one person other than the original author before being released for use by the broader community in beta pilot workshops. 
If a lesson has more than one author, co-authors can review each other's content. 
Community members can also serve as reviewers. A reviewer commits to carefully
reading and testing all code for a lesson or set of episodes and leaving detailed
feedback for lesson authors to correct any errors or other issues found. This feedback is 
provided as issues and/or pull requests (PRs) in the lesson's GitHub repository 
(we'll explain all of that soon!). Authors modify the lessons based on reviewer feedback to ensure the 
lesson is bug-free, all code runs as expected, exercises are appropriate and test
only the concepts being taught, and in general that the lesson is ready to be
delivered to learners in a beta pilot workshop.

Don't worry - this review stage is not the only point at which lessons will
receive feedback. Our collaborative lesson development model ensures that 
Instructors and other community members will continue to engage with the lesson 
materials at all stages of their development and provide near real-time feedback
to keep the lessons in good shape for as long as they are actively being taught!

Reviewers do not need to have any particular domain background or tool expertise. 
In fact, we recommend including reviewers who are complete novices either
the tool being taught by the lesson and/or the lesson's target domain. This can
help overcome authors' [expert blind spot](link to appropriate instructor training page). 

Reviewers should also include people from different geographic regions and
cultural and linguistic contexts than the lessons' authors. If all of
a lesson's authors are based in the UK, for example, there should be at least
one reviewer from outside the UK, and ideally from a non-majority English-speaking
area. Ensuring that lessons are reviewed by people from a variety of cultural and linguistic 
contexts helps us to avoid colloquialisms, culturally-specific references, and other issues that might make our lessons less accessible to a global community. You will likely need one or two reviewers for every
two hours of lesson content. A four-hour (half day) lesson should have at least two to four reviewers.

[Include something about accessibility?]

### Lesson Maintainers

Lesson Maintainers are essential for the long-term viability of a lesson. As a
lesson is taught, new Instructors and learners identify potential places
for improvement - whether correcting a typo, simplifying code, or suggesting
a significant shift in the narrative of a lesson. Maintainers proactively monitor
their lesson's GitHub repository to make sure that PRs and issues are addressed
in a timely manner. Maintainers also play a vital role in communicating with 
contributors, ensuring that our community lives up to its ideals in welcoming
and appreciating contributions from everyone - from first-time contributors to long-time
members of The Carpentries community.

People acting as Maintainers should be experienced with the tool that is being 
taught in the lesson, ideally using it daily or weekly in their own work. In 
addition, they should have experience working in a relevant domain related to the
lesson materials and/or experience working with GitHub and the other technologies
we use to create and host our lessons (link to that section of Handbook). Each
lesson will have at least two Maintainers, and it's ok for one Maintainer
to have domain experience and another to be more comfortable with the technical
aspects of lesson maintainence. 

#### Maintainer recruitment, requirements and time commitment

It's a good idea to recruit three or four Maintainers per lesson, as some may not complete onboarding
or may realize that they don't have the time to commit to this role.

Maintainer onboarding (how to run)

Maintainer meetings and skill development / office hours

A lesson should have at least two or three trained and active Maintainers before it enters the 
beta pilot workshop phase. Before that time, lesson feedback and edits will be 
managed by the lesson authors.

### Curriculum Advisors

Curriculum Advisors provide high-level oversight, vision, and leadership for a
curriculum and guide large-scale updates. Unlike Maintainers, who are responsible
for the day-to-day work of keeping lessons stable and teachable, Curriculum 
Advisors maintain a broader perspective on the state of the field and make 
strategic decisions about major changes to a lesson, for example, updating the
technology being taught to take into account major advances in the field or 
changing the dataset used in the lessons to appeal to a braoder group of learners.

A Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC)
is composed of 5-8 people with significant domain expertise who represent the 
breadth of the field that a curriculum is intended to reach. For example, the
[Data Carpentry Geospatial CAC](https://datacarpentry.org/lesson-leadership/)
includes researchers in ecology, limnology, environmental sciences, and sociology,
along with university staff leading institutional GIS education efforts. Multiple
career levels are represented, from PhD candidates at the end of their graduate
work, to mid-late career professionals. At least one member of the CAC should
be actively teaching in the field, so they can bring a practical perspective
about what skills students and early-career researchers need. Lesson Maintainers
may also serve as Curriculum Advisors, but most Curriculum Advisors will not
also be Maintainers. Curriculum Advisors commit to a minimum one-year term, but 
may serve multiple terms. A CAC should include members from multiple geographic
regions and cultural and linguistic contexts to ensure that the curriculum 
meets the needs of our global community. 

A Curriculum Advisory Committee meets virtually approximately twice a year to
discuss and make decisions about proposed large-scale
changes to the lessons within their curriculum. These proposals may be initiated
by community members, including Maintainers, or by members of the CAC. The CAC
communicates their recommendations back to the Lesson Maintainers and provides
consulation and support to Maintainers in implementing proposed changes. 

Ideally, a Curriculum Advisory Committee should be assembled in the initial
stages of lesson development, before materials start to be drafted. The CAC
can then provide high-level guidance, including defining the learning objectives
and core content for the curriculum and selecting an appropriate dataset that 
will speak to a broad group of learners. However, we recognize that lesson 
development may be part of a grant or other structure with requirements that are
incompatible with putting together a CAC at such an early stage. If a curriculum
will be included in the official Carpentries lesson stack, there
must be a Curriculum Advisory Committee in place at the time of 
its first publication. The CAC must should regularly for as long as a curriculum
remains active. 

### Beta Pilot Instructors

A new lesson or curriculum is often taught for the first time locally at 
the organization that houses the lesson authors. This can be an opportunity 
to troubleshoot organizational or technological issues with the lesson, and
should certainly be done if resources allow, but is
not a sufficient test of the lesson's broader teachability. It is always easier
for the creator of a set of curricular materials to use those materials, but
more difficult to communicate all of the relevant details to enable
others to deliver the curriculum efficiently. In order to ensure
that our lessons are able to be taught by all appropriately experienced 
certified Instructors, a lesson should be beta piloted at least twice outside of the institution 
in which it was developed, ideally in two different countries. Because lessons at this stage are
expected to still have some technical and flow issues, instructors for these beta pilot
workshops should be certified Carpentries Instructors who have previously taught at least two
Carpentries workshops. Instructors with this level of experience will be more prepared to troubleshoot
issues that arise during the workshop, and more likely to provide useful feedback after the workshop. 
Beta pilot instructors may be lesson reviewers,
Maintainers, Curriculum Advisors, or any Carpentries community member other than
lesson authors. In fact, recruiting beta pilot instructors from these areas is likely to be fruitful,
as these people are already playing active roles in the lesson and are invested in bringing the lesson
to maturity. For two beta pilot workshops, you will need at least four instructors.
